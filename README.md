# Microgrid Trading Using Reinforcement Learning
 This code is for a graduation project, then transformed into 3 papers presented at ICCCEEE20 available at IEEEXPLORE relating to the managment and control of a trading game between islanded microgrids with different deep reinforcement learning techniques run on a custom environment.
 
 The paper presents an algorithm that acts as a trading controller for islanded microgrids, applied to data from Sudanese villages. The paper uses two Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms, DDPG and PPO on the environment designed by the researchers.
 DOI for the 3 papers are:
